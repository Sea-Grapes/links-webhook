# Webhook Generator

A simple tool to easily generate a bookmarklet for fetching discord webhooks. Useful for saving urls to a discord channel (If you want to do this for some reason). I have no clue why I made this into a "SaaS" tool lmao, could have literally been a cmd line thing but noooo. Also people keep figuring out my webhook url (probably via bots generating links) so I need a quick way to update them.
